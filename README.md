# Bangbet Web Scraper with Python: Automate Betting Data Extraction

This Python script automates the extraction of soccer betting data from **Bangbet**. It scrapes match times, team names, and betting odds (home, draw, away) from the Bangbet website, providing a quick and efficient way to gather betting data for further analysis.

## üìå Features

- **Automated Betting Data Scraping**: Extracts match times, teams, and odds from Bangbet‚Äôs soccer section.
- **CSV Output**: Saves the data into a CSV file for easy access and analysis.
- **Headless Browser**: Runs in a headless mode (no GUI), making the scraping process more efficient.
- **Handles Pagination**: Automatically scrolls and loads more matches, ensuring complete data collection.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Detects and removes duplicate records to maintain clean datasets.

## üöÄ How It Works

The scraper visits the Bangbet sports betting page, extracts soccer match details, and saves the data in a structured CSV format. The script scrolls through the available matches and loads additional data by clicking the "Load More" button, ensuring all available matches are scraped.

### Key Steps:

1. **Headless Browser Setup**: The script uses a headless Selenium browser to navigate the Bangbet website.
2. **Click and Scroll**: It clicks the "Today" section to load today's matches and scrolls through pages to capture all match data.
3. **Data Scraping**: Using `lxml`, the script extracts match times, home/away teams, and betting odds.
4. **Data Storage**: The scraped data is saved as a CSV file for easy access and analysis.
5. **Duplicate Handling**: Ensures no duplicate records in the final output file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Before running the script, ensure the following packages are installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Selenium**
- **BeautifulSoup4**
- **lxml**
- **pandas**
- **ChromeDriver** (or the appropriate driver for your browser)

Install the required packages using pip:
